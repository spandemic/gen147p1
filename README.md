# Basketball Lore

Description: Noteworthy basketball players across multiple eras lead their cities against well known GOAT candidates.

Artist Statement: I was trying to create random narratives that don't exactly correspond to real world basketball events; however by using names and cities that are real, I create a connection between fiction and reality. I think this works well in the context of basketball, where narratives are usually constructed between generations of players. Sometimes the text generated makes no sense, but occasionally there will be references to real world scenarios, I believe there is a good mix of both. I only used players that I could come up with off my memory, so there may be some biases.
